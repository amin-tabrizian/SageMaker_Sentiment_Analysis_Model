# SageMaker Deployment Project

This a complete project from end to end. In this project, we will have a simple web page that a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review. 

# Note
Now the end point on AWS is deleted. So, the webpage no longer works. But, the neural network model is trained completely with sample reviews and is able to predict positive and negative ones.
